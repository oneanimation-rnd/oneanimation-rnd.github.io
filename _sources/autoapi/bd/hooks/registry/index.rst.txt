.. py:class:: HookRegistry

   Bases: :py:obj:`object`

   This class is used to add and retrieve hook items.

   It is passed as an argument into the 'register' function
   of every individual plugin to allow it to decide which
   callback is going to be registered for which hook name.


   .. py:method:: add_hook(name, callback, priority=50)

      Associated a callback with the hook name.

      :param name: A hook name.
      :param callback: Function or method.
      :type callback: callable
      :param priority: Priority level.
                       Execution starts from the items with the highest
                       priority and follows to the items with the lower one.
                       If multiple items have exactly the same priority, they
                       will be executed in the order they were added into the
                       registry.
      :type priority: int

      :raises InvalidCallbackError: If the 'callback' argument is not callable.


   .. py:method:: get_hooks(name)

      Return a list of hook items registered under the specified hook name.

      It also sorts hook items by their priorities in the descending order,
      so the item with the highest priority goes first.

      :param name: A hook name.

      :returns:

                A list of all the hook items
                    registered under the specified hook name.
      :rtype: list[HookItem]

      :raises HookNotFoundError: If the hook name has no registered hook items.
