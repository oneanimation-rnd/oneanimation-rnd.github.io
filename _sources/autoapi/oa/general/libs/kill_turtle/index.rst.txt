.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Turtle is a native plugin for rendering.
   When Turtle is enabled and a scene saves it writes a 'requires' line in the file, which auto-loads the plugin and its nodes when the scene is re-opened.
   This makes it difficult to completely remove and spreads like a virus.

   This module is an attempt to remove it like the tick it is.
